# About Potter Movie Forum

The objective of this project is to create a React app that allows users to view the Harry Potter Movies. The home page is designed to show all of the movies by default or to be filter via the search function at the top of the app. The user can click on a card for a specific movie to go to a route for details on that movie.

The user can return to the home page via clicking the website title or the home button in the Navbar. The user can also navigate to the forum by clicking that button in the Navbar.

From the forum route the user can see comments left by other users. They can also leave their own forum comment by filling in the form and casting the Aparecium spell (submit button). Posts to the forum persist.

# Technology Used
